<h2 align="center">Usage</h2>
<table border="2" cellspacing="2">
<tr>
<td> On startup</td><td>  by default, vhv will read voltages from the database and start with the power off.  You can override this behavior from the command line.  The "-hvfile" option allows you to specify a text file to read from instead of the database (still starts with power off).  The "-recover" option asks vhv to start up using the current voltage/power settings in the HV crates (useful for recovering from a vhv crash in the middle of a run!).</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td> To permanently update the HV settings</td><td>  Select "Write to DB".</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td> To save a set of HV values for a special test</td><td>  Select "Save File" and give an informative name to your file.</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td> To read the default HV settings</td><td>  Select "Read from DB".</td>
</tr> <tr>
<td> If the database is inaccessible</td><td>  on startup, before the main window opens you"ll get a dialog box asking you to open an HV file.  Select your favorite -- note that default.hv is linked to a file that matches what"s in the database.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Also, vhv periodically writes the current settings to a file "now.hv" -- so if you have been adjusting voltages and vhv crashes, this file is a useful recovery point.</p>
