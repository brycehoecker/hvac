# First line of file must contain four integers:  
# 1.  Check time in milliseconds -- if PMT current is above normal threshold
#     at some time and again above it "check time" later, pixel gets suppressed
# 2.  Normal threshold for suppressing pixels
# 4.  High threshold for immediately suppressing pixels.
# 4.  Pattern threshold -- if 3 adjacent pixels are above this threshold, then
#     suppress all three immediately.
